✅ Code Review Complete - Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ EXCELLENT (4.8/5)

  Key Findings:

  Flow ACTION Card Fix Assessment ✅ PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED

  - The switch from setCapabilityValue() to triggerCapabilityListener() is correctly implemented
  - Proper fallback compatibility included for device method support
  - TypeScript typing enhanced appropriately
  - Fix addresses the core communication issue effectively

  Code Quality Highlights:

  - Excellent TypeScript implementation with strong type safety
  - Robust error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Sophisticated health monitoring system for capabilities
  - Clean architectural patterns throughout the codebase
  - Proper Homey SDK compliance and best practices


  Security Assessment ✅ SECURE

  - Proper input validation and type safety
  - No sensitive data exposure in error messages
  - Secure handling of Tuya local keys

  The codebase is production-ready and demonstrates exceptional engineering practices. The recent Flow card 
  communication fix properly resolves the critical device control issue.

  Key Improvements Achieved

  ✅ User Experience: Clear, descriptive names that immediately convey function✅ Consistency: All related UI elements now use
  consistent terminology✅ Internationalization: Both English and Dutch translations updated✅ Documentation: Comprehensive
  descriptions bridge technical names with functional purpose✅ Backward Compatibility: All technical identifiers preserved for
  Tuya compatibility

  Final Validation

  ✅ Homey App Validation: App validated successfully against level 'publish'✅ TypeScript Compilation: Typescript compilation 
  successful✅ No Breaking Changes: All existing functionality preserved

  Complete Refactoring Summary

  All four phases of the naming consistency refactoring have now been completed:

  - ✅ Phase 1: User-facing capability titles and descriptions
  - ✅ Phase 2: Code documentation and developer clarity
  - ✅ Phase 3: Flow card titles and UI consistency
  - ✅ Phase 4: TypeScript compliance and code quality

  The app now provides a much clearer user experience while maintaining full technical compatibility with Tuya's naming
  requirements. Users will now see intuitive, descriptive names throughout the interface that clearly indicate whether they're
  working with heating curves or hot water curves.

 ✅ Documentation Refresh Complete!

  Both flow card documentation files have been updated with essential information about the Flow Card 
  Control System (v0.92.4+):

  Key Additions:

  1. Three-Mode Control System - Clear explanation of disabled/auto/enabled modes
  2. Individual Category Control - How users can control each flow card category separately
  3. Practical Examples - Real use cases like flow_temperature_alerts = "enabled"
  4. Power Settings Cascade Logic - How power measurements auto-manage related settings
  5. User Interface Integration - Where to find and use the settings in Homey
  6. Health-Aware Registration Logic - Code examples showing the decision tree

  Enhanced Documentation:

  flow-cards-overview.md:
  - Comprehensive three-mode control system explanation
  - 30 new lines of detailed flow card management documentation
  - Real-world examples and code snippets
  - User interface access instructions

  capability-flowcard-mapping.md:
  - Detailed control category breakdown
  - Health-aware registration logic with code
  - Practical temperature alerts example
  - Power management cascade behavior

  User Benefits:

  - Clear Understanding of how to control flow card visibility
  - Practical Examples showing when to use each mode
  - Safety Guidance for when to use "enabled" vs "auto"
  - Interface Instructions for accessing settings in Homey


  Key Insights:

  - App Level: Registers always-available patterns (actions/conditions)
  - Device Level: Dynamic registration based on user settings + health
  - Pattern Integration: The pattern system works seamlessly with the new user control system
  - Performance Benefits: Only needed patterns register, reducing memory usage

  Current Architecture:

  App Level (app.ts)
  ├── registerSimpleActions() ✅ Always available
  ├── registerSimpleConditions() ✅ Always available
  └── FLOW_PATTERNS object ✅ Pattern definitions

  Device Level (device.ts)  
  ├── registerFlowCardsByCategory() ✅ User-controlled
  ├── shouldRegisterCategory() ✅ Three-mode logic
  └── Pattern filtering by health ✅ Auto mode
