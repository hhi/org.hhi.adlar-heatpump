  Key Improvements Achieved

  ✅ User Experience: Clear, descriptive names that immediately convey function✅ Consistency: All related UI elements now use
  consistent terminology✅ Internationalization: Both English and Dutch translations updated✅ Documentation: Comprehensive
  descriptions bridge technical names with functional purpose✅ Backward Compatibility: All technical identifiers preserved for
  Tuya compatibility

  Final Validation

  ✅ Homey App Validation: App validated successfully against level 'publish'✅ TypeScript Compilation: Typescript compilation 
  successful✅ No Breaking Changes: All existing functionality preserved

  Complete Refactoring Summary

  All four phases of the naming consistency refactoring have now been completed:

  - ✅ Phase 1: User-facing capability titles and descriptions
  - ✅ Phase 2: Code documentation and developer clarity
  - ✅ Phase 3: Flow card titles and UI consistency
  - ✅ Phase 4: TypeScript compliance and code quality

  The app now provides a much clearer user experience while maintaining full technical compatibility with Tuya's naming
  requirements. Users will now see intuitive, descriptive names throughout the interface that clearly indicate whether they're
  working with heating curves or hot water curves.
