    "en": "CRITICAL FIX: Optimistic updates for responsive UI and reliable sync. Reverted v0.99.51 (caused crashes and deadlocks). Capability listeners now use optimistic pattern: immediately set value, then send to device. Device response confirms or overrides. Fixes: GUI updates instantly, internal values stay in sync, Tuya app changes propagate correctly, no crashes. Homey SDK setCapabilityValue() does NOT trigger listeners programmatically - no feedback loops."
