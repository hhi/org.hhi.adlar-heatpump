    âœ… Implemented Critical Notifications:

  1. Connection Failures

  - Triggers after 5 consecutive reconnection failures (100 seconds)
  - Notifies: "Device Connection Lost - Heat pump disconnected for over 1 minute"

  2. System Faults

  - Monitors adlar_fault capability
  - Notifies: "System Fault Detected - Fault code: X. Check system immediately"

  3. Temperature Safety

  - Extreme temperatures (>80Â°C or <-20Â°C)
  - Notifies: "Temperature Alert - Extreme temperature detected. System safety compromised"

  4. Pulse-Steps Safety

  - Critical pulse-steps readings (>480 or <0)
  - Notifies: "Pulse-Steps Alert - Critical pulse-steps reading. System requires attention"

  Smart Features:

  - Rate limiting: Max 1 notification per 30 minutes per device (prevents spam)
  - Device-specific: Includes device name in notification
  - Automatic monitoring: Checks all incoming sensor data
  - Non-blocking: Won't crash app if notification fails

  The system now provides proactive user alerts for all critical heat pump conditions while
  preventing notification spam!
