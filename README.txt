INSTALLATION

WHAT DO YOU NEED?
- Homey Pro (firmware version 12.2.0 or higher)
- Adlar Castra Aurora heat pump
- Local network connection to the heat pump
- Device credentials (ID, Local Key, IP address)

HOW TO OBTAIN DEVICE CREDENTIALS?
You can obtain the required local key and other data by following the instructions in:
/docs/Tuya_LocalKey_Homey_Guide_EN.pdf

INSTALLATION STEPS
1. Install the app via the Homey App Store
2. Add a new device and select "Intelligent Heat Pump"
3. Enter your device credentials:
   - Device ID
   - Local Key
   - IP address
   - Protocol Version (choose 3.3, 3.4, or 3.5)
4. Complete the pairing process

PROTOCOL VERSION SELECTION
The protocol version determines how the app communicates with your heat pump:
- 3.3 (Default): Works for most Adlar/Aurora heat pumps
- 3.4: Required for some newer models
- 3.5: Required for latest firmware versions

If you experience connection problems (frequent disconnects, ECONNRESET errors),
try a different protocol version via device repair (see Troubleshooting section).
- ECONNRESET at 00:00 usually occurs due to daily reset of your router;
- HMAC mismatch, default is protocol version 3.3, switch to 3.4 (or 3.5)
- ECONNREFUSED <ip-address> most likely indicates an incorrect IP address,
   assign a static (DHCP) address to your heat pump

IMPORTANT CAPABILITIES

TEMPERATURE MONITORING
- Water inlet and outlet temperatures
- Ambient temperature

ENERGY AND EFFICIENCY
- Real-time power consumption
- Daily and total energy consumption
- COP calculation (how efficiently your heat pump works)
- Trend analysis for optimization
- Seasonal performance monitoring

SYSTEM CONTROL
- On/off switching
- Heating mode selection

COP (COEFFICIENT OF PERFORMANCE) MONITORING

The app automatically calculates how efficiently your heat pump works (see directory /docs/COP calculation at sourcecode):
- COP value: Ratio between generated heat and consumed electricity
- Daily averages: 24-hour trends
- Weekly analysis: Long-term performance
- Seasonal monitoring: SCOP according to European standards
- Diagnostic feedback: What affects efficiency

WHAT DO COP VALUES MEAN?
- COP 2.0-3.0: Average performance
- COP 3.0-4.0: Good performance
- COP 4.0+: Excellent performance

TROUBLESHOOTING AND SUPPORT

COMMON PROBLEMS

Connection Issues (ECONNRESET Errors)
If your device keeps disconnecting or shows connection reset errors:

QUICK FIX (takes less than 2 minutes):
1. Open device Settings in Homey app
2. Scroll to the top to the connection settings
3. Change Protocol Version to 3.4 (or try 3.5 if 3.4 doesn't work)
4. Optional: update other credentials (IP Address, Local Key, Device ID)
5. Click "Save" and wait 1-2 minutes for reconnection

Success indicators:
- Connection status shows "connected"
- No more ECONNRESET errors
- Sensor data updates normally
- Device stays available

Other Common Problems:
- No connection: Check IP address, local key, and network connectivity
- Fluctuating values: Normal during system startup
- Error codes: See the app for specific explanation per error code
- Pairing fails: Try different protocol versions (3.3, 3.4, 3.5)

UPDATE DEVICE CREDENTIALS
You can update device credentials without re-pairing:
1. Go to device Settings in Homey app
2. Scroll to the top to the connection settings
3. Update credentials (IP Address, Local Key, Device ID, Protocol Version)
4. Click "Save" - device reconnects automatically
