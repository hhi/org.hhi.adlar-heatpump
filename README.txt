    âœ… Implemented Critical Notifications:

  1. Connection Failures

  - Triggers after 5 consecutive reconnection failures (100 seconds)
  - Notifies: "Device Connection Lost - Heat pump disconnected for over 1 minute"

  2. System Faults

  - Monitors adlar_fault capability
  - Notifies: "System Fault Detected - Fault code: X. Check system immediately"

  3. Temperature Safety

  - Extreme temperatures (>80Â°C or <-20Â°C)
  - Notifies: "Temperature Alert - Extreme temperature detected. System safety compromised"

  4. Pressure Safety

  - Critical pressure readings (>50 or <0)
  - Notifies: "Pressure Alert - Critical pressure reading. System requires attention"

  Smart Features:

  - Rate limiting: Max 1 notification per 30 minutes per device (prevents spam)
  - Device-specific: Includes device name in notification
  - Automatic monitoring: Checks all incoming sensor data
  - Non-blocking: Won't crash app if notification fails

  Additional Suggestions:

  You could also add notifications for:
  - Electrical imbalance from flow cards (3-phase current monitoring)
  - Extended maintenance mode (compressor/defrost stuck states)
  - Communication errors (invalid DPS data patterns)

  The system now provides proactive user alerts for all critical heat pump conditions while
  preventing notification spam!
