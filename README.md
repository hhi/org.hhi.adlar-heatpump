### Getting Device Credentials

To obtain the required local key, refer to the documentation:
`docs/Get Local Keys - instruction.pdf`

### Installation Steps

1. Install the app from the Homey App Store
2. Add a new device and select "Intelligent Heat Pump"
3. Enter your device credentials:
   - **Device ID**: Unique identifier for your heat pump
   - **Local Key**: Security key for encrypted communication
   - **IP Address**: Local network IP of your heat pump
4. Complete the pairing process

## Configuration

### Device Settings

Access device settings to configure:

#### Flow Card Controls (v0.92.4+)

- **Temperature Alerts** (11 cards): Control temperature-related flow card visibility
- **Voltage Alerts** (3 cards): Manage voltage monitoring flow cards
- **Current Alerts** (3 cards): Configure electrical current flow cards
- **Power Alerts** (3 cards): Control power monitoring flow cards
- **Pulse-steps Alerts** (2 cards): Manage valve position flow cards
- **State Alerts** (5 cards): Configure system state change flow cards
- **Expert Mode** (3 cards): Enable advanced diagnostic flow cards

Each category offers three modes:

- **Disabled**: Flow cards are not available - Clean interface, unused sensors
- **Auto**: Flow cards appear only for healthy sensors with data - **Default** reliable alerts
- **Enabled**: All flow cards are available regardless of sensor status - Safety critical, troubleshooting

**Smart Integration**: Power measurements toggle automatically manages related flow card settings to prevent inconsistent configurations.

#### Feature Settings (App restart required)
