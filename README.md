- **Dynamic Curve Calculator**: Calculate values based on configurable curves (e.g., weather-compensated heating)

#### Advanced: Calculate Value from Curve

Dynamically calculate output values based on input conditions using configurable curves.

##### Primary Use Case: Weather-Compensated Heating

Automatically adjust heating setpoint based on outdoor temperature for optimal efficiency:

![Curve Calculator in Action](docs/Curve%20calculator.png)
*Screenshot: Weather-compensated heating flow with real-time results*

```text
WHEN   Outdoor temperature changed
THEN   Calculate value from curve
       Input: {{outdoor_temperature}}
       Curve: < 0 : 55, < 5 : 50, < 10 : 45, < 15 : 40, default : 35
AND    Set target temperature to {{result_value}}
```

##### Curve Format

Each line: `[operator] threshold : output_value`

##### Supported Operators

- `>` - Greater than
- `>=` - Greater than or equal (default if no operator specified)
- `<` - Less than
- `<=` - Less than or equal
- `==` - Equal to
- `!=` - Not equal to
- `default` or `*` - Fallback value (always use as last line)

##### Evaluation Rules

1. Evaluates from **top to bottom**
2. Returns **first matching** condition
3. Falls back to `default` if no match

##### Example Curves

Basic Heating Curve (outdoor temp → heating setpoint):

```text
< -5 : 60    (Extreme cold → maximum heating)
< 0  : 55    (Freezing → high heating)
< 5  : 50    (Cold → medium heating)
< 10 : 45    (Cool → moderate heating)
< 15 : 40    (Mild → low heating)
default : 35 (Warm → minimal heating)
```

Time-Based Hot Water (hour of day → hot water temp):

```text
>= 22 : 45   (Night → energy saving mode)
>= 18 : 55   (Evening → normal)
>= 6  : 60   (Morning/day → comfort mode)
default : 45 (Default → energy saving)
```

COP-Based Optimization (current COP → temp adjustment):

```text
< 2.0 : -5   (Low efficiency → reduce 5°C)
< 2.5 : -3   (Moderate → reduce 3°C)
>= 3.5 : +2  (High efficiency → increase 2°C)
default : 0  (Normal → no change)
```

##### Best Practices

- ✅ Always add `default : <value>` as last line (prevents errors)
- ✅ Use newlines or commas to separate rules
- ✅ Test your curve with different inputs before deploying
- ✅ Keep curves simple (max 50 entries)
- ⚠️ Curves evaluate top to bottom - order matters!

##### Error Messages

The calculator provides clear error messages:

- `"Input value must be a valid number"` - Check your input tag
- `"No matching curve condition found for input value: X"` - Add a `default` line
- `"Invalid curve syntax at line N"` - Check operator and format
- `"Curve exceeds maximum allowed entries (50)"` - Simplify your curve

### Cross-App Integration

**External Data Flow Pattern**:
1. Heat pump triggers `request_external_power_data` when COP calculation needs external power data
2. Your power meter flow responds with `receive_external_power_data` action
3. Enhanced COP calculation uses both internal sensors and external measurements
4. Similar patterns for `request_external_flow_data` and `request_external_ambient_data`

## Internationalization

- ✅ **Eliminated Race Conditions**: Removed self-terminating callbacks and concurrent operation conflicts
- ✅ **Proper Error Recovery**: Failed reconnection attempts now properly trigger exponential backoff instead of silent failure

**Technical Changes:**

- 🔧 Fixed early exit break in `scheduleNextReconnectionAttempt()` (always reschedule, never break recursion)
- 🔧 Removed DPS refresh zombie detection (heartbeat handles this, prevents temporal paradoxes)
- 🔧 Added recovery path on `forceReconnect()` failure (proper backoff on reconnection failure)
- 🔧 Simplified DPS refresh (NAT keep-alive only, no wait loops)
- 🔧 Added concurrent `forceReconnect()` safeguard (prevents race conditions)

**Impact:**

This release simplifies credential management by eliminating the intermediary repair dialog.

### v0.99.59 - Protocol Version Selection

**Critical Feature:**

- ✅ **Protocol Version Selection**: Choose Tuya protocol version (3.3, 3.4, 3.5) during pairing
- ✅ **ECONNRESET Resolution**: Solves persistent connection issues caused by protocol mismatch
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Existing devices continue using protocol 3.3 automatically

**Technical Implementation:**

- ✅ Protocol version stored in both device store and settings for reliability
- ✅ Automatic reconnection when protocol version changes
- ✅ Comprehensive user documentation ([USER_QUICK_FIX.md](docs/USER_QUICK_FIX.md), [PROTOCOL_VERSION_GUIDE.md](docs/PROTOCOL_VERSION_GUIDE.md))

This release resolved connection stability issues for users with devices requiring non-default protocol versions.

### v0.99.58 - ECONNRESET Stability Improvements

**Critical Fix:**

- ✅ App no longer crashes on network interruptions
- ✅ Fixed connection reset errors causing app unresponsiveness
- ✅ Automatic reconnection now works correctly after ECONNRESET

This version improved stability but required manual app reinstall if protocol version was incorrect. v0.99.59 adds user-controllable protocol selection.

### v0.99.57 - Documentation Update

**Improvements:**

- ✅ Enhanced installation guides
- ✅ Updated technical documentation
- ✅ Improved architecture overview

### v0.99.56 - Dual Picker/Sensor Architecture

**Enhanced UX:**

- ✅ Added dual picker/sensor architecture for heating and hot water curve controls

- ✅ Single DPS update maintains consistency across both capabilities
- ✅ Cleaner default UI while preserving full control for power users

This release resolves the iPhone picker bug by providing always-visible read-only status displays with optional control pickers.

### v0.99.49 - Deep Socket Handler Timing Fix

**Critical Timing Fix:**
- ✅ Fixed v0.99.48 handler installation timing - now installs AFTER `.connect()` when socket exists
- ✅ TuyAPI only creates `.device` object during connection, not during constructor
- ✅ Handler now reinstalls after EVERY successful reconnection (not just initial connection)
- ✅ Added idempotent listener cleanup with `removeAllListeners('error')` to prevent duplicates
- ✅ Enhanced logging with emoji indicators (🛡️ ✅ ⚠️) for easier troubleshooting

**Why v0.99.48 Didn't Work:**
v0.99.48 installed the deep socket handler BEFORE calling `this.tuya.connect()`, but TuyAPI only creates the internal `.device` object DURING the connect call. Result: handler tried to attach to a non-existent object, leaving socket errors unhandled.

**v0.99.49 Solution:**
```typescript
await this.tuya.connect();              // Socket created HERE
this.installDeepSocketErrorHandler();   // Handler installed AFTER socket exists
```

Handler now installed at two critical points:
1. After initial connection in `initialize()`
2. After every successful reconnection in `connectTuya()`

This ensures the deep socket error handler is ALWAYS active on the actual socket.

### v0.99.48 - Deep Socket Error Interception (Timing Issue)

**Note:** This version had a timing bug - handler installed before socket existed. See v0.99.49 for fix.

**Attempted Fix:**
- Added deep socket error handler concept
- Accessed TuyAPI's internal `.device` object
- Integration with error recovery system

**Issue Identified:**
Handler installed too early (before `.connect()`), so `.device` object didn't exist yet.

### v0.99.47 - Real-time Connection Status

**New Features:**
- ✅ Added `adlar_connection_status` capability for live connection monitoring
- ✅ Real-time status updates every 5 seconds (connected/disconnected/reconnecting/error)
- ✅ Visual connection status icon with matching app design style
- ✅ Enhanced user visibility into Tuya device connection health

**Technical Implementation:**
- ✅ TuyaConnectionService tracks connection state changes at all transition points
- ✅ Device.ts polls status via ServiceCoordinator every 5 seconds
- ✅ Status enum properly differentiates recoverable reconnections from critical errors

This release provides users with immediate visibility into device connectivity status.

### v0.99.46 - Production-Ready Release

**Critical Fixes:**
- ✅ Fixed ECONNRESET crash bug during connection failures
- ✅ Implemented unhandled promise rejection protection in async callbacks
- ✅ Added global error handlers (`unhandledRejection`, `uncaughtException`)

**Enhanced User Experience:**
- ✅ Automatic device status updates (unavailable during outages, available after reconnection)
- ✅ Triple-layer crash prevention architecture
- ✅ Enhanced connection resilience with improved recovery notifications

**Technical Improvements:**
- ✅ `.catch()` handlers on all setTimeout/setInterval async callbacks
- ✅ Device availability sync with TuyaConnectionService connection state
- ✅ Comprehensive error logging for production diagnostics

**Icon Updates:**
- ✅ Added custom countdown timer icon (`adlar_countdowntimer`) matching app visual style

This release marks the transition from beta to production-ready stability.
