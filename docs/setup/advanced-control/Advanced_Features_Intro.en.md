- ✅ Dynamic UA correction during strong wind (+20-50% additional heat loss)
- ✅ Better heating demand prediction during storms
- ✅ More accurate τ (time constant) calculation

> [!NOTE]
> **Impact of wind on heat loss:**
>
> Wind increases heat loss through **convective cooling** of facades. During storms (>50 km/h), heat loss can be **20-50% higher** than in calm conditions.
>
> | Wind speed | Extra heat loss | W_corr typical |
> |------------|-----------------|---------------:|
> | 0-10 km/h | Negligible | 0.00-0.03 |
> | 10-30 km/h | +5-15% | 0.03-0.07 |
> | 30-50 km/h | +15-30% | 0.07-0.10 |
> | >50 km/h | +30-50% | 0.10-0.12 |
>
> **Functions without wind correction:**
>
> - Building model still works, but UA value is an average without wind correction
> - During storms, prediction can deviate by 10-20%
>
> **Conclusion:** External connection is *optional* but provides significantly better predictions with variable wind.

### 1.7 Connect External Solar Panel Power (for Solar Radiation Calculation)

Connect your solar inverter (e.g., SolarEdge, Enphase) for accurate solar radiation calculation based on current PV power.

![PV current power setup](../images/Setup%20-%20PV%20actueel%20vermogen.png)

**How to set up:**
```
WHEN: [SolarEdge] Power changed
THEN: [Intelligent Heat Pump] Send solar panel power {{Power}}W to heat pump
```

**What this unlocks:**

- ✅ Calculate solar radiation from PV power and panel specifications
- ✅ Alternative to direct radiation sensor (if not available)
- ✅ Accurate g-factor determination in building model
- ✅ Optimal solar gain modeling

> [!NOTE]
> **Deriving solar radiation from PV power:**
>
> The app can **calculate** solar radiation from your solar panels' current power:
>
> **Formula:** `Radiation (W/m²) = PV power (W) / (Panel area (m²) × Efficiency (%))`
>
> **Example:**
>
> - 10 panels of 1.7m² with 20% efficiency = 3.4 m² effective area
> - At 2000W PV power → Radiation = 2000 / 3.4 = ~588 W/m²
>
> **Advantages vs. direct radiation sensor:**
>
> - ✅ No additional sensor needed (uses existing PV monitoring)
> - ✅ Represents actual radiation at your location and orientation
> - ⚠️ However less accurate with dirty panels or shade
>
> **Choice between PV power and radiation sensor:**
>
> | Situation | Best choice |
> |-----------|-------------|
> | Solar panels available | PV power (pragmatic) |
> | No solar panels | KNMI radiation sensor |
> | Optimal accuracy | Connect both (app uses best source) |
>
> **Conclusion:** PV power is a *smart alternative source* for solar radiation data.
