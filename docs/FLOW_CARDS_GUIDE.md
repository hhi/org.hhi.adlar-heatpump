## Triggers

### 1. ðŸš¨ Fault Detected

**ID**: `fault_detected`
**Category**: Device Safety
**When it triggers**: When the heat pump reports a system fault (DPS 15 > 0)

#### Configuration

```yaml
WHEN: Fault code [fault_code] detected
```

**Parameters**:
- `fault_code` (range 1-100): Specific fault code to monitor
  - Leave blank to trigger on ANY fault
  - Specify code (e.g., 3) to trigger only on that fault

**Tokens Available**:
- `fault_code` (number): The fault code number
- `fault_description` (string): Human-readable description in your language

#### Supported Fault Codes

| Code | English | Nederlands |
|------|---------|------------|
| 0 | No fault | Geen storing |
| 1 | High pressure protection | Hogedrukbeveiliging |
| 2 | Low pressure protection | Lagedrukbeveiliging |
| 3 | Compressor overheating | Compressor oververhitting |
| 4 | Discharge temperature too high | Uitlaattemperatuur te hoog |
| 5 | Water flow sensor fault | Waterdoorstroomsensor storing |
| 6 | Inlet temperature sensor fault | Inlaattemperatuursensor storing |
| 7 | Outlet temperature sensor fault | Uitlaattemperatuursensor storing |
| 8 | Ambient temperature sensor fault | Omgevingstemperatuursensor storing |
| 9 | Coil temperature sensor fault | Spoeltemperatuursensor storing |
| 10 | Low water flow protection | Lage waterdoorstroom beveiliging |
| 11 | Antifreeze protection active | Vorstbeveiliging actief |
| 12 | Phase loss or reverse phase | Faseuitval of omkeerde fase |
| 13 | Communication error | Communicatiefout |
| 14 | EEV valve fault | EEV-klep storing |
| 15 | System pressure abnormal | Systeemdruk abnormaal |

#### Example Flows

**Critical Fault Notification**:
```
WHEN: Fault detected
  AND fault_code is 1, 2, 3, or 4
THEN: Send notification "Critical heat pump fault: {{fault_description}}"
  AND Turn off device
  AND Send email to maintenance
```

**Sensor Fault Auto-Recovery**:
```
WHEN: Fault detected
  AND fault_code is 6, 7, 8, or 9
THEN: Wait 5 minutes
  AND Restart device
  AND Check if fault cleared
```

**Antifreeze Alert**:
```
WHEN: Fault detected
  AND fault_code is 11
THEN: Send notification "Antifreeze protection activated"
  AND Increase target temperature by 2Â°C
```

#### Technical Details

- **Detection**: Monitors DPS 15 (`adlar_fault` capability)
- **Trigger Logic**: Only triggers on **new** faults (change detection)
- **Deduplication**: Same fault code won't retrigger until cleared (code returns to 0)
- **Language Support**: Fault descriptions automatically localized (EN/NL)
- **Performance**: Zero overhead when no fault present

#### Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Fault trigger fires repeatedly for same fault
**Solution**: This should not happen due to change detection. Check device logs for fault code oscillation.

**Problem**: Fault description shows "Unknown fault (code: X)"
**Solution**: The fault code is not in the standard mapping table. Report code to developer for addition.

**Problem**: Trigger doesn't fire despite fault visible in device status
**Solution**:
1. Check trigger is not disabled in flow settings
2. Verify flow card is enabled in device settings â†’ Flow Card Control
3. Check app logs for error messages

---

### 2. âš¡ Power Threshold Exceeded

**ID**: `power_threshold_exceeded`
**Category**: Energy Management
**When it triggers**: When power consumption exceeds configured threshold

#### Configuration

```yaml
WHEN: Power consumption exceeded [threshold] W
```

**Parameters**:
- `threshold` (100-10000W): Power threshold in watts
  - Default: 3000W
  - Recommended: Set to 120% of normal maximum

**Tokens Available**:
- `current_power` (number): Current power consumption in watts
- `threshold_power` (number): The configured threshold

#### Smart Features

**Hysteresis Protection** (5%):
- Once triggered at 3000W, must drop below 2850W to reset
- Prevents trigger spam from power oscillations
- Example: 2990W â†’ 3010W â†’ TRIGGER â†’ 2995W â†’ (no retrigger)

**Rate Limiting** (5 minutes):
- Maximum 1 trigger per 5 minutes
- Prevents notification flood during sustained overload
- Logs rate-limited events for diagnostics

#### Example Flows

**High Consumption Alert**:
```
WHEN: Power threshold exceeded 3500W
THEN: Send notification "High power usage: {{current_power}}W"
  AND Log to Google Sheets with timestamp
```

**Overload Protection**:
```
WHEN: Power threshold exceeded 4500W
THEN: Lower target temperature by 2Â°C
  AND Wait 5 minutes
  AND Check if power dropped below 4000W
```

**Time-of-Use Optimization**:
```
WHEN: Power threshold exceeded 3000W
  AND Time is between 17:00 and 21:00 (peak hours)
THEN: Switch to Economy mode
  AND Send notification "Switched to economy mode during peak hours"
```

**Smart Home Integration**:
```
WHEN: Power threshold exceeded 4000W
THEN: Check if EV is charging
  AND Pause EV charging temporarily
  AND Resume after 15 minutes
```

#### Configuration Tips

**Setting the Right Threshold**:
1. Monitor normal operation for 24 hours
2. Note maximum power during heating cycle (~3000-4000W typical)
3. Set threshold to 120% of maximum (e.g., 4800W if max is 4000W)
4. This ensures trigger only on genuine overload

**Device Settings Integration**:
- Go to Device Settings â†’ Advanced â†’ Power Threshold
- Set custom threshold (default: 3000W)
- Service will automatically use this value

#### Technical Details

- **Monitoring**: Checks every power update (~10 seconds)
- **State Machine**: Tracks `powerAboveThreshold` boolean
- **Hysteresis Formula**: `reset_threshold = threshold * 0.95`
- **Rate Limit**: 300,000ms (5 minutes) minimum between triggers
- **Performance**: ~2ms processing time per check

#### Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Trigger fires too often (every minute)
**Solution**:
- Threshold too low - increase by 500W increments
- Check rate limiting is working (should see "rate limited" in logs)

**Problem**: Trigger never fires despite high power
**Solution**:
1. Verify power monitoring is enabled (Device Settings â†’ Energy Tracking)
2. Check `measure_power` capability has valid data
3. Confirm threshold is set correctly in settings

**Problem**: Trigger fires and immediately resets
**Solution**: This is normal behavior with hysteresis. Power dropped below 95% threshold.

### 3. ðŸŽ¯ Total Consumption Milestone

**ID**: `total_consumption_milestone`
**Category**: Goal Tracking
**When it triggers**: When cumulative energy consumption reaches 100 kWh milestones

#### Configuration

```yaml
WHEN: Total consumption reached [milestone] kWh
```

**Parameters**:
- `milestone` (100-50000 kWh): Milestone value
  - Auto-triggers at: 100, 200, 300, ..., 1000, 1100, etc.
  - **Increment**: Fixed at 100 kWh steps

**Tokens Available**:
- `total_consumption` (number): Current total consumption in kWh
- `milestone_value` (number): The milestone that was reached

#### Milestone Behavior

**First Run Catch-Up**:
If you install the app with existing consumption (e.g., 523 kWh):
- Will trigger for ALL milestones: 100, 200, 300, 400, 500
- This is intentional to catch up on missed milestones
- Subsequent milestones trigger normally (only new ones)

**Deduplication**:
- Each milestone only triggers once (ever)
- Tracked in device store: `triggered_energy_milestones`
- Survives app restarts and updates
- Can be reset manually if needed

#### Example Flows

**Monthly Budget Tracking**:
```
WHEN: Milestone reached 300 kWh
THEN: Send notification "Monthly budget reached: {{total_consumption}} kWh"
  AND Calculate cost: {{total_consumption}} * â‚¬0.30
  AND Log to Insights
```

**Seasonal Goal Tracking**:
```
WHEN: Milestone reached 1000 kWh
THEN: Send notification "Seasonal milestone: {{milestone_value}} kWh"
  AND Compare to last year's data
  AND Send efficiency report
```

**Cost Alert**:
```
WHEN: Milestone reached [any]
THEN: Calculate cost: {{milestone_value}} * â‚¬0.30
  AND IF cost > monthly budget
    THEN Send warning notification
```

**Gamification**:
```
WHEN: Milestone reached [any]
THEN: Send positive notification "Achievement unlocked: {{milestone_value}} kWh!"
  AND Show progress bar: {{total_consumption}} / 2000 kWh target
```

#### Configuration Tips

**Understanding Milestones**:
- 100 kWh â‰ˆ â‚¬30-50 typical electricity cost
- Average heat pump: ~100-150 kWh per week in winter
- Annual consumption: ~5000-8000 kWh (= 50-80 milestones)

**Resetting Milestones** (if needed):
```javascript
// In Homey Developer Tools â†’ Device Storage
// Delete key: 'triggered_energy_milestones'
// Next milestone will catch up from zero
```

#### Technical Details

- **Trigger Point**: After each energy update (~30 seconds)
- **Storage**: Array of triggered milestones in device store
- **Deduplication**: `if (!triggeredMilestones.includes(milestone))`
- **Catch-Up Logic**: Loops from 100 to `highestMilestone` on first run
- **Performance**: O(n) where n = number of milestones (negligible)

#### Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Multiple milestone triggers at once
**Solution**: Normal on first install. Each milestone triggers once. Subsequent runs trigger only new milestones.

**Problem**: Milestone doesn't trigger despite reaching 100 kWh
**Solution**:
1. Check `meter_power.electric_total` capability has data
2. Verify energy tracking is enabled
3. Check device logs for milestone check execution

**Problem**: Want to change milestone increment (not 100 kWh)
**Solution**: Currently fixed at 100 kWh. Use flow conditions to filter:
```
WHEN: Milestone reached [any]
  AND milestone_value MOD 500 = 0
THEN: (only triggers at 500, 1000, 1500, etc.)
```

## Conditions

### 4. ðŸŽ¯ COP Efficiency Check

**ID**: `cop_efficiency_check`
**Category**: Performance Monitoring
**When it's true**: When current COP exceeds threshold AND compressor is running

#### Configuration

```yaml
IF: COP efficiency is above/below [threshold]
```

**Parameters**:
- `threshold` (1.0-8.0): COP threshold value
  - Default: 2.0
  - Typical range: 2.5-4.5 for heat pumps
  - Excellent: > 4.0, Good: 3.0-4.0, Poor: < 2.5

#### Smart Behavior

**Compressor State Check**:
- **Returns `false` when compressor idle** (even if COP > threshold)
- Why? COP=0 during idle is technical correct but misleading in flows
- Prevents false positives in "IF COP < 2.0" flows

**Real-Time Monitoring**:
- Uses current `adlar_cop` capability (updated every 30 seconds)
- Reflects instantaneous efficiency, not averages

#### Example Flows

**Efficiency Alert**:
```
IF: COP efficiency is below 2.5
  AND Device is on
THEN: Send notification "Low efficiency: COP {{adlar_cop}}"
  AND Check for issues
```

**Optimization Trigger**:
```
IF: COP efficiency is above 4.0
  AND Outdoor temperature < 0Â°C
THEN: Send notification "Excellent efficiency despite cold weather!"
  AND Log as reference point
```

**Dynamic Temperature Adjustment**:
```
IF: COP efficiency is below 2.0
  AND Running for > 30 minutes
THEN: Decrease target temperature by 1Â°C
  AND Wait 15 minutes
  AND Recheck efficiency
```

**Smart Defrost Detection**:
```
IF: COP efficiency is below 1.5
  AND Compressor is running
  AND Coil temperature < outlet temperature
THEN: Assume defrost needed
  AND Log timestamp for pattern analysis
```

#### Configuration Tips

**Setting Thresholds**:
- **Critical threshold**: < 2.0 (investigate immediately)
- **Warning threshold**: < 2.5 (monitor closely)
- **Good target**: > 3.0 (typical operation)
- **Excellent**: > 4.0 (ideal conditions)

**Factors Affecting COP**:
- Outdoor temperature (major impact)
- Water flow rate
- Temperature differential
- System age and maintenance
- Defrost cycles (temporarily lower COP)

#### Technical Details

- **Data Source**: `adlar_cop` capability (real-time)
- **Compressor Check**: `measure_frequency.compressor_strength > 0`
- **Update Frequency**: Every 30 seconds (follows COP calculation interval)
- **Return Logic**: `false` if idle, `(currentCOP > threshold)` if running

#### Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Condition always returns false
**Solution**: Check if compressor is running. Condition intentionally returns false during idle.

**Problem**: COP reads as 0 but compressor is running
**Solution**:
1. Check power measurement is available
2. Verify temperature sensors have valid data
3. Check COP calculation is enabled in settings

**Problem**: Condition triggers false alarms
**Solution**: Increase threshold slightly. COP can temporarily dip during:
- Defrost cycles
- System startup
- Extreme outdoor temperatures

### 5. ðŸ“Š Daily COP Above Threshold

**ID**: `daily_cop_above_threshold`
**Category**: Performance Monitoring
**When it's true**: When 24-hour rolling average COP exceeds threshold

#### Configuration

```yaml
IF: Daily COP is above/below [threshold]
```

**Parameters**:
- `threshold` (1.0-8.0): Daily COP threshold
  - Default: 2.5
  - Recommended: 3.0 for good daily performance

#### Smart Behavior

**Data Availability Check**:
- **Returns `false` if insufficient data** (dailyCOP = 0)
- Requires at least 10 data points (~5 minutes of operation)
- This prevents false positives on startup

**Rolling Average**:
- Calculates COP over last 24 hours
- Weighted by runtime (idle periods excluded)
- More stable than real-time COP

#### Example Flows

**Daily Performance Report**:
```
EVERY DAY at 23:59:
IF: Daily COP above 3.0
THEN: Send notification "Good daily efficiency: {{adlar_cop_daily}}"
ELSE: Send notification "Below target: {{adlar_cop_daily}} (target: 3.0)"
```

**Maintenance Scheduling**:
```
EVERY WEEK:
IF: Daily COP below 2.5
  FOR 3 consecutive days
THEN: Send notification "Maintenance may be needed"
  AND Schedule inspection
```

**Weather Correlation**:
```
EVERY DAY at 22:00:
IF: Daily COP above 3.5
  AND Average outdoor temperature < -5Â°C
THEN: Log as "Excellent performance in cold weather"
```

#### Configuration Tips

**Understanding Daily COP**:
- Smooths out short-term fluctuations
- Better indicator of overall system health
- Less sensitive to defrost cycles than real-time COP

**Typical Daily Values**:
- Winter (< 0Â°C): 2.5-3.5
- Spring/Fall (5-15Â°C): 3.5-4.5
- Summer (> 20Â°C): 4.0-5.0+

#### Technical Details

- **Data Source**: `adlar_cop_daily` capability
- **Calculation**: RollingCOPCalculator.getDailyCOP()
- **Update Frequency**: Every 5 minutes
- **Data Points**: Circular buffer of last 1440 points (24 hours @ 1/min)
- **Idle Awareness**: Excludes periods with compressor off

---

### 6. ðŸ“ˆ Monthly COP Above Threshold

**ID**: `monthly_cop_above_threshold`
**Category**: Long-Term Performance
**When it's true**: When 30-day rolling average COP exceeds threshold

#### Configuration

```yaml
IF: Monthly COP is above/below [threshold]
```

**Parameters**:
- `threshold` (1.0-8.0): Monthly COP threshold
  - Default: 3.0
  - Target: > 3.5 for excellent seasonal performance

#### Smart Behavior

**Long-Term Averaging**:
- 30-day rolling window
- Smooths weather variations
- Best indicator of system efficiency over time

**Data Validation**:
- Returns `false` if monthlyCOP = 0 (insufficient data)
- Requires multiple days of operation for reliable average

#### Example Flows

**Monthly Report**:
```
EVERY 1st day of month at 09:00:
IF: Monthly COP above 3.5
THEN: Send notification "Excellent monthly efficiency: {{adlar_cop_monthly}}"
  AND Calculate estimated costs
  AND Compare to previous months
```

**Seasonal Optimization**:
```
EVERY MONTH:
IF: Monthly COP below 3.0
  AND Season is Winter
THEN: Review system settings
  AND Consider insulation improvements
  AND Send efficiency tips
```

**Predictive Maintenance**:
```
EVERY MONTH:
IF: Monthly COP dropped by > 10% vs last month
THEN: Send alert "Efficiency declining"
  AND Recommend filter check
  AND Schedule professional inspection
```

#### Configuration Tips

**Seasonal Expectations**:
- Heating Season (Oct-Apr): Target > 3.0
- Shoulder Seasons (Mar-May, Sep-Oct): Target > 4.0
- Cooling Season (Jun-Aug): Target > 4.5

**Trend Analysis**:
- Track monthly COP over time
- Declining trend may indicate:
  - System aging
  - Need for maintenance
  - Refrigerant loss
  - Component failure

#### Technical Details

- **Data Source**: `adlar_cop_monthly` capability
- **Calculation**: RollingCOPCalculator.getMonthlyCOP()
- **Update Frequency**: Every 5 minutes
- **Data Points**: 30-day circular buffer
- **Weighting**: Runtime-weighted average

### 7. âœ… Temperature Differential

**ID**: `temperature_differential`
**Category**: System Health
**Status**: âœ… **Production-ready since v0.99** (verified in v1.0.7)

#### Configuration

```yaml
IF: Temperature differential is above/below [differential]Â°C
```

**Parameters**:
- `differential` (1-50Â°C): Temperature difference threshold
  - Typical: 5-10Â°C for efficient operation
  - Too low (< 3Â°C): Poor heat transfer
  - Too high (> 15Â°C): Possible flow issues

#### Smart Behavior

**Null-Safe Calculation**:
- Falls back to 0Â°C if sensor unavailable
- Logs fallback usage for debugging
- Prevents flow errors from missing data

**Bidirectional Check**:
- Uses `Math.abs(inlet - outlet)`
- Works regardless of flow direction
- Suitable for both heating and cooling modes

#### Example Flows

**Heat Transfer Efficiency**:
```
IF: Temperature differential below 3Â°C
  AND Compressor is running
THEN: Send notification "Poor heat transfer detected"
  AND Check water flow rate
  AND Verify pump operation
```

**Ideal Operating Point**:
```
IF: Temperature differential between 5Â°C and 10Â°C
  AND Power consumption < 3000W
THEN: Log as "Ideal efficiency point"
```

**Flow Problem Detection**:
```
IF: Temperature differential above 15Â°C
  AND Water flow below 20 L/min
THEN: Send alert "Possible flow restriction"
  AND Recommend filter check
```

#### Technical Details

- **Calculation**: `Math.abs(temp_top - temp_bottom)`
- **Sensors**: `measure_temperature.temp_top`, `measure_temperature.temp_bottom`
- **Null Handling**: Defaults to 0 with debug logging
- **Update Frequency**: Every DPS update (~10 seconds)

## Settings Configuration

### Power Threshold Setting

To configure custom power threshold:
1. Go to Device Settings â†’ Advanced
2. Find "Power Threshold (W)" setting
3. Set desired threshold (100-10000W)
4. Default: 3000W

**Note**: If setting doesn't exist, trigger will use hardcoded default (3000W).

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### General Issues

**Flow cards not visible in Homey app**:
1. Check app version is 1.0.7 or higher
2. Restart Homey app
3. Check flow card settings: Device Settings â†’ Flow Card Control
4. Ensure relevant capability has data (not null)

**Triggers fire but flows don't execute**:
1. Check flow is enabled (not paused)
2. Verify flow logic conditions
3. Check Homey's flow execution logs
4. Test with simple flow first (just notification)

**Conditions always return false**:
1. Check capability has valid data (not null/0)
2. Verify device is operational (not offline)
3. Check specific condition requirements (e.g., compressor running for COP)
4. Enable debug mode and check logs

### Diagnostic Commands

**Check capability values**:
```javascript
// In Homey Developer Tools â†’ Device Capabilities
adlar_cop // Should show current COP
adlar_fault // Should show 0 (no fault) or fault code
measure_power // Should show current power in watts
meter_power.electric_total // Should show cumulative kWh
```

**Check triggered milestones**:
```javascript
// In Homey Developer Tools â†’ Device Storage
triggered_energy_milestones // Array of triggered milestones
```

**Reset milestone tracking**:
```javascript
// Delete storage key: triggered_energy_milestones
// Next milestone will retrigger from zero
```

## Best Practices

### Flow Design

**1. Use Appropriate Granularity**:
- Real-time COP: For immediate alerts
- Daily COP: For daily reports
- Monthly COP: For trend analysis

**2. Combine Conditions**:
```
IF: COP below 2.0
  AND Power above 3000W
  AND Running for > 15 minutes
THEN: Investigate (not normal to have low COP with high power)
```

**3. Add Hysteresis in Flows**:
```
WHEN: Power threshold exceeded
THEN: Wait 5 minutes
  AND IF still above threshold
    THEN Take action
```

**4. Log for Analysis**:
```
WHEN: Any efficiency trigger
THEN: Log to Insights with all relevant data
  - Timestamp
  - COP value
  - Outdoor temperature
  - Power consumption
```

### Notification Management

**Prevent Spam**:
- Use rate limiting (built-in for power/fault triggers)
- Add time-based conditions (not between 22:00-08:00)
- Combine multiple checks before notifying

**Prioritize Alerts**:
- Critical: Faults, power overload â†’ Immediate notification
- Warning: Low COP, high consumption â†’ Daily digest
- Info: Milestones, good performance â†’ Weekly summary
